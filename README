dwm - dynamic window manager
---
Personal fork of dwm with changes, and patches to suit my needs.

Dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Requirements
---
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
You also want st, dmenu, and sxhkd for the keybindings to work.
The default font is FiraMono Medium.

Patches

* fake full screen
* sticky
* noborder
